Saudi Arabia had the first crack at goal with Abdulrahman Sufyani releasing Abdulhadi Matari in the eighth minute but the striker’s low shot was well claimed by Uzbekistan custodian Nematulloh Rustamjonov. Uzbekistan then started to impose themselves but were limited to half-chances with efforts from Nurbek Sarsenbaev and two from Abubakir Shukurullaev not troubling Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Abdulrahman Al Otaibi. The cagey game took an unexpected twist in the 40th minute when a tussle between Sarsenbaev and Adel Hibah on the touchline saw the Uzbekistan player shown the red card for kicking out his opponent while on the ground. Matters got worse for the Central Asian side in the second minute of time added on as they went down to nine men following Miraziz Abdukarimov’s last man challenge on Sabri Dahal. Uzbekistan, however, sported a determined look after the interval and took the game to Saudi Arabia despite their numerical disadvantage. Their aggression paid off in the 51st minute after a VAR check confirmed Yazeed Al Dosari’s handball with Muhammad Khakimov making no mistake from 12 yards. Saudi Arabia looked for a quick response but close range attempts from Thari Saeed, Sufyani and Mukhtar Barnawi were well defended by a line of Uzbekistan players across the goalmouth. The home fans at King Fahd Sports City Stadium were stunned into silence in the 70th minute after a quick break saw a surging Sadriddin Khasanov dribbling past Alwaleed Aloufi on the left before slotting past Al Otaibi to seal Uzbekistan’s amazing victory.
